We now begin an exploration of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  
<br />The next four weeks will be devoted to the Second Law and its consequences.
This study will be heavy, and in some parts, the mathematics may turn out to be quite involved.

Be patient, be calm, and you will enjoy the study of the Second Law.

Note: This week, at many places, there are more than one video in the same unit.
Please look up the pinned discussion "Why do the videos not show up in the bar on the top?"

The Quiz for this week will be released on Friday.</pre>
