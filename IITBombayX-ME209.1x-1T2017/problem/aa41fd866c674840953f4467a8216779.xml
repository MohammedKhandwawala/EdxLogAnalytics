      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Open, closed and isolated systems are defined depending on whether mass is allowed to travel across the system boundaries. Even if the mass was constant over an interval of time, it gives us no information as to whether flow of mass is actually permitted across boundaries or not.</p>
