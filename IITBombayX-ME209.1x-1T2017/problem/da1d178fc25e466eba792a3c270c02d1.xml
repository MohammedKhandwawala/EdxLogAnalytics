    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>In steady state, the input mass flow rate remains constant at 5/10 kg/s. </p>
      <p>Also, the mass contained in the control volume does not change with respect to time.</p>
      <p>Hence, the exit mass flow rate is the same as the input mass flow rate</p>
