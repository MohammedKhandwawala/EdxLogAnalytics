  <p>A closed system initially has a pressure of 1 bar, and a volume of 3 cm[mathjaxinline]^ {3}[/mathjaxinline]. The system is heated, due to which its volume expands.  The new volume is now 10 cm[mathjaxinline] ^ {3}[/mathjaxinline], while the pressure is 3 bar.  The process can be represented by a linear line on the [mathjaxinline]p-V[/mathjaxinline] diagram.  Determine the work done by the system, in joule [J]. </p>
  <p>(Hint: draw the process on a [mathjaxinline]p-V[/mathjaxinline] diagram and then calculate the area under the curve.) </p>
