      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Idealizations like assuming something is frictionless, massless is allowed. The state of C cannot change. It can undergo a complete cycle, or not undergo any process, but a change in volume is a change in the state of C. C cannot contain something defined in thermodynamics, only something defined in other branches of physics. C cannot contain any black box elements, the working and design of everything must be known and completely specified.</p>
