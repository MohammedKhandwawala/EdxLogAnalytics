      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>A, C, and D are all assumptions in the classical domain of thermodynamics. We never assume that a general system is perfectly insulated, since we consider heat to be a form of energy transfer. Volume is a state property of the system; it may change during a process. It is not always necessary that a process be quasi-static.</p>
