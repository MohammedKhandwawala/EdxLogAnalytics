  <p>Which of the following are true?</p>
  <choiceresponse>
    <checkboxgroup direction="vertical">
      <choice correct="true">The work done by the system on the surroundings is negative of work done by the surroundings on the system.</choice>
      <choice correct="true">The work done by a system in a process can be zero.</choice>
      <choice correct="true">A system consists of gas inside a piston-cylinder arrangement.The piston is attached to a spring, whose other end is attached to a wall. The pressure inside the system increases slightly, so the piston moves outward and the spring is compressed. The work done by the system is positive.</choice>

  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The work done by system on surroundings is always negative of work done by surroundings on system. An arbitrary process need not involve any net work done by the system. In case C, the system volume increases, so the work done is [mathjaxinline] (p [/mathjaxinline] [mathjaxinline]dV)[/mathjaxinline] , where [mathjaxinline]dV[/mathjaxinline] is positive.</p>
