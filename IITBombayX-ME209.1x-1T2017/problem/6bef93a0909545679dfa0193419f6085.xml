      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Use Bernoulli's equation. Since density is a positive quantity, it can be shown that the exit velocity will be negative irrespective of the magnitude of density. This implies that one cannot push water through from the inlet at 10 m/s and expect it to come out from the exit for the given height and pressure differences</p>
